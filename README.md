A collection of codemods powered by TS-Morph and PostCSS

## Use

```sh
yarn --cwd ./packages/codemod transform global-css-to-css-modules
```

## Build

```sh
yarn
yarn build
```

## Test

```sh
yarn test

## Release

Releases are done automatically in CI when commits are merged into master by analyzing [Conventional Commit Messages](https://conventionalcommits.org/).
After running `yarn`, commit messages will be linted automatically when committing though a git hook.
The git hook can be circumvented for fixup commits with [git's `fixup!` autosquash feature](https://fle.github.io/git-tip-keep-your-branch-clean-with-fixup-and-autosquash.html), or by passing `--no-verify` to `git commit`.
You may have to rebase a branch before merging to ensure it has a proper commit history, or squash merge with a manually edited commit message that conforms to the convention.
