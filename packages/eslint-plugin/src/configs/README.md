# Premade configs

These configs exist for your convenience. They contain configuration intended to save you time and effort when configuring your project by disabling rules known to conflict with this repository, or cause issues in TypeScript codebases.

## `all`

The `all` set simply contains every single rule in this plugin, turn on with its default configuration.
There may be some conflicts between the rules as defaults do not quite align - please file an issue if you encounter any of these.

This set is considered unstable, as any new rules will be added with only a minor package version bump.
